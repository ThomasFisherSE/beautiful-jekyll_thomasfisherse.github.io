I am a senior software engineer passionate about taking complex problems and transforming them into clean, well-structured code. With over 6 years of industry experience and 4 years of academic experience specializing in C#, C++, and Unity development, I have honed my software development and problem solving skills while working on a range of interesting, cutting-edge software solutions.

I graduated from Swansea University with a Master of Engineering (MEng) degree in Computing with First Class Honours in 2018, where I received an award for best overall performance in my class and department, achieving a first in all modules I completed over the 4 year degree. Academic projects I worked on included creating an augmented reality warehouse logistics application integrating into existing industry-used APIs (C#, Unity, REST), designing a space-shooter video game that utilized a genetic algorithm for enemy AI (C#, Unity, machine learning), and implementing an object-oriented backpropagation neural network architecture (C++, machine learning).

After graduating, I joined Rockfield Software as a software engineer. There, I worked on developing and maintaining the Elfen suite of geomechanics simulation software products primarily using C++ and Qt, refining my skills in agile development and cross-functional teamwork. This role honed my ability to quickly adapt to complex, industry-specific challenges, demonstrating my capacity to learn and excel in new areas.

In my current role at Masters of Pie, I work with .NET (C#) and Unity to create immersive XR collaboration solutions. I have worked on a range of projects including Radical SDK, which can be integrated into industry solutions to provide real-time collaboration capabilities, an XR-capable rendering engine, and I play a key role in the development of a bespoke defence sector XR collaboration application with GIS integration, contributing significantly to its success.

In my free time, I enjoy learning to play instruments including bass and electric guitar, making and drinking coffee (see my [BaristaAI personal project](https://thomasfisherse.github.io/2025-01-10-BaristaAI/)), and exploring technologies, from building / upgrading computers to Raspberry Pi projects.
