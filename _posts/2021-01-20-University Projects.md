During my time at Swansea University while obtaining my Master's Degree in Computing (MEng), I was involved in many interesting projects. This page lists some highlights with links to their corresponding git repositories.

## [Augmented Reality Warehousing Tool on Android](https://github.com/meffersino/veeqoARApp)

An augmented reality application that warehouse staff can use on custom Veeqo scanner devices or their smartphone in order to help their productivity. When the user's device is pointed at a QR code accompanied by an AR anchor marker printed on a shipping box, an AR overlay will be displayed showing useful information such as what is inside the box, quantity, whether it is needed for a stock check etc.

This is a team project I worked on with an industry partner, Veeqo, a software company based in Swansea. At the time, Veeqo was a fairly small start-up, but has since been [acquired by Amazon](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/07/amazon-acquires-e-commerce-software-start-up-veeqo.html). The project was completed as part of a software team project module in my final year at University, with our team being awarded a first.

## [Evolutionary Game in Unity](https://github.com/ThomasFisherSE/EvolutionaryGame)

A space shooter game where enemy ships improve through successive waves using a genetic algorithm.

This was an individual project which I completed as part of a software delivery project module in the final year of my MEng Computing course, for which I was awarded a first.

## [Generic Backpropagation Neural Network in C++](https://github.com/ThomasFisherSE/GenericBackpropNN)

A generic object-oriented implementation of a simple feedforward / backpropagation neural network in C++.

This project was completed for my third year Computing dissertation at Swansea University, which earned me a first in all relevant modules (software engineering project planning & management, software engineering project specification & development, and software engineering project implementation & dissertation).

## [Kablewie - Java Minesweeper Game](https://github.com/ThomasFisherSE/Kablewie-Minesweeper)

A minesweeper-type game written in Java.

Completed as part of the second year of my degree as part of a small team. Our team was awarded a first for our work on this as part of a software engineering module.

## [Kablewie+ - Upgraded Java Minesweeper Game](https://github.com/ThomasFisherSE/KablewiePlus-Minesweeper)

Similarly to the ["Kablewie - Java Minesweeper Game"](https://github.com/ThomasFisherSE/Kablewie-Minesweeper) project detailed above, this is a minesweeper type game written in Java, but with some additional more advanced features such as saving and loading, a self-playing AI, and an option to reveal the location of mines.

This was completed later in the second year of my degree as part of another software engineering module with the same team of developers that I worked with on the original Kablewie project. This time, we were provided with a different existing "Kablewie" application and tasked with improving it with the features mentioned above. Again our team was awarded with a first.

## [Game Suite in Java](https://github.com/ThomasFisherSE/Java-GameSuite)

After creating [Kablewie](https://github.com/ThomasFisherSE/Kablewie-Minesweeper) and [Kablewie+](https://github.com/ThomasFisherSE/KablewiePlus-Minesweeper), a software engineering module assignment tasked our team with creating a game suite application which could be used to play one of two games - the existing Kablewie game, or a yet to be implemented Ludo type game.

After the implementation of the Ludo game, the game suite application was also built so that it could be used as a launcher for Kablewie or Ludo.

This concluded the software engineering modules in my second year, earning our team another first in this final assignment.

## [Merkles Puzzles in Java](https://github.com/ThomasFisherSE/Merkles-Puzzles-Implementation)

In my third year of University, I was tasked with a pair-programming project to demonstrate how the cryptographic key-exchange approach 'Merkles's puzzles' works. Myself and my partner achieved a first on this assignment.
