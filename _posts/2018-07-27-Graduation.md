I'm incredibly proud to confirm I have graduated with a Master's Degree in Computing (MEng) with First Class Honours!

Whilst I was over the moon with this achievement in itself, my graduation ceremony came with an additional surprise when I was presented the award for "Best Overall performance by a Final year Student on a 4 Year Degree in the College of Science Department of Computer Science".
